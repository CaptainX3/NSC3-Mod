tech_pd_destroyer_1:0 "PD Destroyer Upgrade"
tech_pd_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Missiles, torpedoes, and strike craft all pose a grave threat to our fleets. Our naval engineers suggest re-designing our Destroyers to mount an array of numerous point-defense weapons to shoot down these targets before they can reach our ships."

tech_StrikeCruiser_1:0 "Strike Cruiser"
tech_StrikeCruiser_1_desc:0 "Battle experience and extensive wargaming exercises show that fleet combat often ends without a decisive outcome, because the losing side makes an immediate, emergency jump to FTL. Our best scientists have miniaturized the Subspace Snare used on starbases for deployment onto a ship. These vessels will be blisteringly fast, to catch enemy fleets in their Snares, maneuverable enough to keep enemy ships from disengaging from combat, and tough enough to withstand significant punishment to ensure the enemy is pinned down for as long as possible."

tech_Battlecruiser_1:0 "Battlecruiser"
tech_Battlecruiser_1_desc:0 "As larger and larger vessels become more common, combat is taking place at longer ranges, and offensive firepower is becoming an ever-more-decisive factor in battle. Our naval theorists suggest building a long, powerful vessel capable of mounting large, medium, and most notably, guided weapon emplacements, to specialize in hurling as much weaponry at the enemy as possible, in either mid- or long-range combat."

tech_escortcarrier_1:0 "Light Carrier Upgrade"
tech_escortcarrier_1_desc:0 "The Battlecruiser class can be repurposed as a dedicated Strike Craft platform, allowing our fleets to bring much needed firepower to the front lines."

tech_Carrier_1:0 "Carrier"
tech_Carrier_1_desc:0 "Strike Craft have proven to be highly successful weapons in naval combat. It is time to design a specialized warship for the express purpose of carrying these weapons into battle, and housing the large support staff and maintenance bays that they require. Doing so will allow these new Carrier vessels to carry far more strike craft than their more improvised predecessors."

tech_heavycarrier_1:0 "Heavy Carrier Upgrade"
tech_heavycarrier_1_desc:0 "As our ship building capabilities continue to increase, we continue to look for new ways to advance our current ship class layouts. Combined with new advancements in miniaturizing many of the support facilities required for the maintenance of strike craft, we believe that we can alter our existing Carrier designs into Heavy Carriers, with the ability to support more hangar bays."

tech_supercarrier_1:0 "Supercarrier Upgrade"
tech_supercarrier_1_desc:0 "Further efforts in both ship construction and miniaturization of strike craft support facilities will allow us to squeeze an absolutely incredible number of hangar bays into our Carriers. These Supercarriers will be able to support swarms of strike craft, the better to defend our fleets from attack, and to overwhelm the foe with our best pilots."

tech_spitfire_1:0 "Spitfire Battleship Specialization"
tech_spitfire_1_desc:0 "While capital ships are far more powerful than any vessels that have come before them, they are also far more expensive, and pose juicy targets for swarms of smaller, cheaper vessels that can overwhelm the capital ships with sheer numbers. To counter this, our engineers are working on a few blueprints that could adapt the Battleship into an anti-Corvette-and-Destroyer powerhouse, along with weapons specifically designed for that purpose. These new designs will cause these 'Spitfire Battleships' to have an even higher production cost, but such sacrifices are worth it, if it means protecting our vulnerable capital ships."

tech_Dreadnought_1:0 "Dreadnought"
tech_Dreadnought_1_desc:0 "The Battleship heralded a new era of ship design and naval combat. The ability to both deliver and take massive damage at long range, and the advent of devastating XL weaponry, have completely changed the nature of warfare. Our naval engineers believe that we should develop an even better version of these powerful ships. Their proposed 'Dreadnoughts' would be capable of mounting heavier defenses, more guns, and even two of the incredible XL weapons that have been so successful on the battlefield."

tech_Flagship_1:0 "The Flagship"
tech_Flagship_1_desc:0 "The naval arms race has seen the production of larger and larger warships with no end in sight. Our naval engineers have suggested jumping to the logical conclusion of this serial escalation by constructing a ship so massive and powerful, that no empire will be able to support more than one of them at a time. This proposed Flagship will be the ultimate warship. Designed for maximum versatility, each section will have many possible configurations, allowing us to design our Flagship to suit our purposes. Mounting far more thrusters per ton than any other ship, the Flagship will be able to take any position in the fleet, from a long-range battery in the rear, to a massive brawler at the tip of a fleet's spear.\n\nThis power and versatility will come at a heavy cost, however. Merely building the Flagship will be an enormous endeavor, requiring a colossal stockpile of resources and a significant investment of time and manpower. Upon completion, it will take the entire GDP of a small star nation to maintain; as a result, it will require a massive amount of political influence to obtain approval for the project."

tech_supportcruiser_1:0 "Support Cruiser Upgrade"
tech_supportcruiser_1_desc:0 "As our fleets grow in size, and the distance they travel from home increases, it becomes necessary to support them internally instead of trying to maintain long-range supply lines.

tech_explorationship_2:0 "Exploration Cruiser (Level 2)"
tech_explorationship_2_desc:0 "Our intrepid Science Officers have faced incredible danger in their quest to explore the galaxy and uncover all the secrets it has to offer. Our naval engineers, pleased with the performance of the Exploration Cruiser, suggest developing a more powerful variant to further increase the protection available to our best and brightest Science Officers."

tech_explorationship_3:0 "Exploration Cruiser (Level 3)"
tech_explorationship_3_desc:0 "Our intrepid Science Officers have faced incredible danger in their quest to explore the galaxy and uncover all the secrets it has to offer. Our naval engineers, pleased with the performance of the Exploration Cruiser's upgraded form, suggest developing an even more powerful variant to further increase the protection available to our best and brightest Science Officers."

tech_explorationship_4:0 "Exploration Cruiser (Level 4)"
tech_explorationship_4_desc:0 "Our intrepid Science Officers have faced incredible danger in their quest to explore the galaxy and uncover all the secrets it has to offer. Our naval engineers, pleased with the performance of the Exploration Cruiser's upgraded form, suggest developing an even more powerful variant to further increase the protection available to our best and brightest Science Officers."

These valuable and highly developed starbases are important installations to our empire, and can support a wide range of facilities."

tech_starbase_7:0 "Solar Stronghold Starbase"
tech_starbase_7_desc:0 "The final upgrade in the starbase chain, the Solar Stronghold is the ultimate command and defense station, the largest class of starbase that it is possible to build. Enemy fleets will break upon these massive bulwarks, and each one is a vital asset to our empire, defending the most critical locations on the galactic map."

tech_space_defense_station_2:0 "Deep Space Defenses 2"
tech_space_defense_station_2_desc:0 "As fleets grow larger and more powerful, it becomes necessary for our defensive installations to grow in strength, as well. These expanded Defense Stations, an upgrade to the basic Defense Platforms we currently use, will allow us to better defend our territory from enemy attack."

tech_space_defense_station_3:0 "Deep Space Defenses 3"
tech_space_defense_station_3_desc:0 "As fleets grow larger and more powerful, it becomes necessary for our defensive installations to grow in strength, as well. These expanded Fortress-level defensive installations, an upgrade to the Defense Stations currently in use, will allow us to better defend our territory from enemy attack."

tech_specialcomponents_1:0 "Advanced Warship Components"
